[2]INTERSECTION (&) gets items only in both.
[3]DIFFERENCE (-) gets items in the first set but not in the second.

Lambda syntax - passing simple function as an argument to another function.

Map and filter::
map - takes function and an iterable as arguments, and returns a new iterable with function 
applied to each argument.

Generators ::
Generators - iterable, don't allow indexing with arbitrary indices, but they can still be iterated
through with for loops. 
(created using "yield" statement)
